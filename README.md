# Introduction
The application is deployed to:
http://ec2-52-7-51-233.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

The credintials for the prototype are user/password

## Getting started
### Running the backend with the frontend
You need Java and Maven to be installed.
From the command line run
`mvn spring-boot:run`

This should start the application on port 8080. http://localhost:8080/


### Running the frontend only
[emberjs](http://emberjs.com/) is the framework of choice.

1. Install emberjs cli `npm install -g ember-cli`
2. Install npm packages `npm install`
2. Install bower packages `bower install`
2. Run the server `ember serve`
3. visit http://localhost:4200

And to run all tests just run `ember test`


## How the code is organized
This is a really simple typical java web application. All the `java` code is
under `src/main/java` and all the web resources (`javascript`, `css`, `html`,
etc) are under `src/main/resources/static/`

### npm Packages
All `npm` packages are installed in their default location under `node_modules`.

### Bower Packages
`bower` packages are installed under `src/main/resources/static/lib` directory.
