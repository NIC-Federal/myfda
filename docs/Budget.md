Budget
======

A budget was established for the prototype based on proposed labor rates and the anticipated labor for the 
engagement.

Initial Budget
--------------

The technical team provided estimates using a top-down approach to provide a budget for the MVP.  The MVP 
was constrained by the shortened time frame of the RFQ (prior to RFQ modification 4). The product manager 
managed this budget during the project until the project was changed at the extension of the response period.

Extended Budget
---------------

When the proposal response period was extended by modification 4 to the RFQ, the team provided budget 
estimates on adding certain features and refinements from the backlog into the MVP of the prototype.  The 
product manager approved the additional iterations/effort and the new features were added to the scope of 
the MVP and additional sprints were added to implement these epics and stories.  No modification to the 
budget and level of effort was made in response to modification 5 of the RFQ which extended the submission 
date.  Resources time sheets were aggregated and totalled by labor category to determine a final level of 
effort that was reported in Attachment C of the response to the Agile Delivery Services RFQ.
