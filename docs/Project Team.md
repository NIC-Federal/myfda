Project Team
============

NIC assembled a multidisciplinary team to tackle the prototype development project.  This agile team 
completed work using 12 of the 13 labor categories defined in Attachment A of the RFQ.  Since resources 
often possessed skills that crossed labor categories, they were asked to split their effort between labor 
categories as needed.  These resources collaboratively developed the prototype and this documentation over 
the RFQ response period.

Team Members
------------

The agile team performing the work consisted of UX designers, visual designers, front-end web developers, 
back-end web developers, a content writer, a DevOps engineer, and a security analyst.  This team conducted 
the prototype design and development in Austin, TX.  The on-site team was supported by remote technology 
resources which were consulted when expertise was needed that did not already exist in the team.

Product Manager
---------------

NIC appointed Andy Ford as the product manager for the MyFDA prototype.  Andy was responsible for and held 
accountable for the success of both the prototype design and development project but also for production of 
project documentation.  The product manager worked alongside the agile team, participating in ceremonies, 
providing guidance when needed, and ensuring that overall objectives were met by the project.

Delivery Manager
----------------

The delivery manager orchestrated the team that implemented the prototype project.  This resource, with 
years of experience leading agile teams using a variety of agile methodologies, was in charge of the agile 
execution of the project.  The delivery manager served as the master of ceremonies, the reminder of rules, 
and the oracle of blockers.  The delivery manager worked beside the team throughout the entire project to 
ensure that work was getting developed according to priorities and the established sprint objectives were 
being met.

Product Owner
-------------

If this were an actual application prototyping exercise for the FDA, an essential member of the team would 
have been a product owner appointed by the FDA.  This agency resource would understand and represent the 
agency's objectives continuously throughout the project.  Moreover, this individual would be responsible for 
indicating when acceptance criteria have been met.  In place of what would have been an agency resource, NIC 
appointed a resource to serve as the product owner.  The resource allocated to this role had proven 
instrumental in the ideation process and therefore could represent the vision for the prototype.  The 
surrogate product owner was asked to think as if he was an agency product owner and the team was asked to 
engage him as if that individual were a product owner representing the FDA.
