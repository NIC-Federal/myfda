MyFDA Project Documentation
===========================

This is an index of the project documentation for the MyFDA prototype project.  A markdown wiki format has been
used for all documentation.  Project documentation is organized into two categories.  Project
Information is the first category and includes general information and information on the approach
used for the project.  The second category of documentation is Technical Information, and includes
documentation intended for developers wishing to install or contribute to the project.
