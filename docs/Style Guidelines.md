CSS Style Guide
---------------

A CSS style guide has been created for the MyFDA prototype.  This was used during the prototype 
implementation and should be referred to by project contributors.  To provide the most utility the 
style-guide was actually implemented within the project itself.  This approach ensured that the style guide 
stayed in sync with styling conventions that were added and changed during the prototype's evolution.  The 
link below will take to the current production style guide used for MyFDA.
