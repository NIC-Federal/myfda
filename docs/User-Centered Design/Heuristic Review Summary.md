Heuristic Review Summary
========================

A series of back-and-forth reviews with an UX expert group were conducted once a release candidate had been developed.  The UX team collaborated with this expert group on multiple layouts for presenting content and features in the final prototype.  This article documents the major findings from these review cycles.

Heuristic Review Findings
-------------------------

The following major findings came from the heuristic reviews:

* The MVP candidate wasnâ€™t a clear enough call-to-action or explanation of what the application does.
* Showing the latest recalls on the bottom of the dashboard were of no real value to the average user and should be eliminated.
* Search form should remain above call to action content since the application is primarily a search engine for FDA-regulated drugs and this concept to be abundantly clear.
* Static call to action content needs formatted as to not seem like navigation, such as a step-based layout to concisely tell the user what they can do with the app and how to get started.
* An about page would be useful to help the user understand what the application represents, what data is used, and limitations for the data.
* All of these findings led to design changes by the UX group to improve the user experience prior to conducting additional usability testing with real users.
