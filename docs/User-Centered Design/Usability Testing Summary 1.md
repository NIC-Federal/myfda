Usability Testing Summary 1
===========================

This article presents the method and major findings from the first round of usability testing that was conducted on design wireframes.

Test Purpose
------------

The first round of user testing was designed to reveal problems in how the UI establishes expectations. We wanted to know whether people incorrectly assess what they can and cannot do in this UI and that they understand the purpose of key sections. A secondary goal will be to get a small, qualitative sample of reactions to the usefulness of the application.

Method
------

Given the time constraints of the project, Nielsen's "guerilla" usability testing tactics were seen as appropriate. We were not looking to validate a design or compare two solutions, and we were not looking for statistically significant evidence. We ran small, lean tests with 4-5 participants to identify problem areas. Rather than wait for design comps or an interactive prototype, the testing was performed using wireframes.

Tasks
-----

1. Show participant a printout of wireframe page 1, landing page.
  a. Based on what you see in this sketch, what can you do in this application?
  b. Is there anything that would be useful to you that you cannot do?
2. Show participant a printout of wireframe page 2, search results.
  a. What can you do on this page?
  b. What does saving a drug do?
3. Show participant a printout of wireframe page 8, log-in, to establish that they are now logged in. Show participant printout of page 7, the authenticated view of the landing page.
  a. What is a portfolio?
  b. What can you do with this list of drugs?
4. Allow participant to look through all pages at will. Open-ended questions:
  a. Does this serve a purpose for you?
  b. Is there anything else it could do that is useful to you?
  
Observations
------------

Four participants were observed. 

* All four participants quickly stated the application would let them search drugs to view recalls and detailed information about the drugs. All four then observed they could receive recall alerts. Only one participant expected to be able to save drugs.
* Three participants did not think of anything they would want from the application. One participant stated he would like to know if adverse events would be listed under all possible names for that drug, so that he could be sure whether there were really no alerts for his drug or there were alerts, but under a different brand name.
* Only two participants noticed the Save button. One assumed she could "save [the drug] for later." The other did not know what it would do.
* When prompted to speculate what Save does, two participants guessed the purpose was to "come back to it later" or "favorite" the drug, so they would not have to search for it next time. One participant stated she did not know why she'd want to save. One stated it would save to a profile of some sort but did not speculate on why.
* One participant looked at the list of drugs and concluded that must be the portfolio. One hesitated, then offered that it must be "your account, where you change your user information." One first said "I don't know", then looked at the list of drugs and concluded that must be the portfolio. One said "things that apply to you."
* Only one participant concluded she would get notifications on the drugs on the list. One participant said she was not sure what the word "notifications (1)" meant. One concluded the list was for printing out and taking to the doctor's office, to keep track of your medications, and that she could also use it to keep track of medications she is allergic to. One observed that he could view drugs and manage the list by deleting, but did not speculate on its purpose.
* Only one participant said she actively looks for recalls, but that she uses Google, not a dedicated site or application. Two participants speculated it might be useful to others: One said it would be useful to people who are more "sensitive" to recalls, and another speculated it could be useful for health care professionals. One participant stated she expected her doctor to be "up to speed" on anything pertinent to medications.

Conclusions and Recommendations
-------------------------------

* The landing page communicated its basic functionality clearly, which is no surprise considering it mainly contains a search and a feed. 
* It was not clear from the landing page, however, that one could somehow save a list of drugs. If this is important, an informational item could be added, though it would have to state the value of saving such a list (see below).
* It is unclear what "Save" does. Changing the label might help, though part of the problem is that the purpose of the list itself is fuzzy. The best solution might be to rename the button "Get alerts," so that there is at least a clear purpose to clicking it.
* The word "portfolio" has no association to a list of drugs and should be changed. The only reason two participants knew what it was is that they saw the list and deduced the headline "portfolio" must be the name for that list. Recommend we do not give it a "name" â€“ a list is a list and does not need to be referred to as anything else. 
* It is not clear that you will receive alerts on all the drugs on your list. One solution is to make alerts specific to each drug and indicate this with an "Alerts on/off" toggle for each.
* If you did not know the drugs list is for alerts and future reference, which several did not, then it is not clear that it has any purpose other than to "bookmark" drugs. That should cause us to question why someone would go to the trouble of setting up an account and logging in to maintain this "list".
